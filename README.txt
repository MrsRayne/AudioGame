This project can easily be connected to VOSK, but Vosk needs to be installed separately. When you have installed VOSK, replace /python/examples/mircophone_test.py with
the mircophone_test.py in this folder and start VOSK, while Unity/Assets/BlindScene/Blind.unity, /RasaFolder/run.cmd and /RasaFolder/runActions.cmd are running.

If you want to run the project without Vosk, run Unity/Assets/BlindScene/Blind.unity, /RasaFolder/RasaShell.cmd and /RasaFolder/run.cmd and enter the text in the shell:
